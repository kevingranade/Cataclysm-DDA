# Introduction
Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a grim sci-fi survival sim set in a post-apocalyptic world poplated with all manner of otherworldly monsters.

# Description (groundhog day?)
As you wake on the 5th day after it started, you take inventory of your gear, it's just what you were wearing and carrying when it all went to hell.  It's not enough to survive on, but maybe enough to get started.
You head out of the shelter to explore, before you're even out of sight of your shelter, you see some people staggering around strangely. Yea them, walkers, shamblers, deadites, whatever they're called, they're everywhere now.
You move a little closer to take a look, and it notices you, turning it's disfigured face in your direction and shambling toward you.
You realize that if you run, you'll lose your shelter, that's not an option right now, so you decide to stand and fight, they don't move that fast after all.
You pause to grab a sturdy-looking stick from the ground, then square off against the zombie.  At first it seems to go fine, you pummel the zombie with your stick over and over.
The zombie is quickly covered with bruises, scrapes and cuts, while you're no worse for wear, just taking a moment to step back after every few blows of your stick.
It's a bit disconcerting that the zombie shows no sign of pain, but you're doing fine until you step back just a little too slowly after an attack, and the zombie's flailing arms make contact.
It's not even a solid hit, but as you stagger back, you lose your balance and fall.  The fall stuns you a lot more than you would have expected, and standing up seems to take an eternity, you're not hurt, but you're a lot more winded than you thought.
Just like that, you realize you're fighting for your life instead of easily dispatching the zombie. You've worn yourself out attacking, and now you realize your attacks don't have the force behind them they had when you started.
The zombie actually manages to land a few more blows with its wild flailing, and you realize you might not make it out of this alive.
You turn to run, but then see your scuffle has attracted a number of other zombies who are closing in from several directions.
You sprint between a pair that aren't too close together and open up a little distance, but now you're really winded, and their shambling gait that seemed almost comical a few minutes ago instead seems menacing and inexorable.
Abandoning the shelter you tried and failed to defend, you lead your pack of shambling pursuers into a thicket, hoping to lose them and at least catch your breath.
After what seems like hours of running, you finally find yourself with no pursuers. Every time you thought you were going to break away, another zombie appeared and joined the chase, forcing you to change course and allowing the others to catch up.
Taking stock, you find yourself covered in bruises and scratches, parched, and famished.  Overall this was disasterous, but if you learned anything, it's that you need a better weapon and to be more careful about engaging zombies when there are many others nearby.

Should you head out and explore or try and cobble together some tools and weapons from your immediate surroundings first? If you head out too soon, *they* could overwhelm you, but if you take too long, you might not find anything useful today, or worse, there might be something out there you should be running from.
After a look around, your next decision, stay or go?  Moving around too much is dangerous, you could run into one of *them* at any time
